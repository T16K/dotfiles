# [Zsh](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zsh)

## Initial Configuration

Before starting, users may want to see what shell is currently being used:
```
$ echo $SHELL
```

Make sure that Zsh has been installed correctly by running the following in a terminal:
```
$ zsh
```

To list all installed shells, run:
```
$ chsh -l
```

And to set one as default for your user do:
```
$ chsh -s full-path-to-shell
```
